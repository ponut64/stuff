Maybe just straight-up add "jetpack"
You press button, move up slightly, but mostly you get directional   in the air.
Perhaps I can make the Y very weak if you're trying to move in a direction,
so jetting near the ground when skiing will be your control method.

I mean, this *was* an essential part of what made tribes fun to play. Limited capacity to move like an angel...

			My best explanation of what's happening here:
			Weight/gravity is pushing the player down, at all times.
			Right now the system does not abstract between force and acceleration; I know that's a major flaw.
			But for now it's a needed simplification so I can understand things.
			So we must interpret this "gravity" as the force itself, in the math, even though it is the weight.
			The weight applies a force to the surface, and this force must be deflected by the surface.
			There's no rebound here though, as the rebound is not controlling the collision state (like it is with walls).
